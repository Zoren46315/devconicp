			<p>A pair of twins who travel across the stars and visit different worlds arrive in the land of Teyvat, but find that the nation 
			of Khaenri'ah is under cataclysmic siege. Attempting to leave to avoid the carnage, the twins are separated by an unknown god, 
			who takes one and seals away the other. Five hundred years later, the sealed twin, referred to as the "Traveler", awakens and 
			meets Paimon. The pair travel to nearby Mondstadt to start their search for the Traveler's missing twin.</p>

			<p>The duo arrive at Mondstadt, and encounter a dragon named Stormterror which attacks the city. Aided by an unknown entity, 
			the Traveler fends off Stormterror and is recognized by Jean, acting Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius. The Traveler 
			helps the Knights restore order to the region, and then meets Venti, a local bard who comes up with a plan to stop Stormterror, 
			whose true name is Dvalin. Venti requests for them to retrieve a holy lyre so that he may play it to Dvalin, calming him. After 
			retrieving the lyre, which was first stolen by Fatui, Venti attempts to calm Dvalin but realizes that the Abyss Order have been 
			manipulating him, and Venti's true identity is revealed: he is secretly Barbatos, the Anemo Archon, and was also the one who 
			guided the Traveler during their fight with Dvalin. The Traveler, accompanied by Jean, Diluc and Venti, pursue Dvalin to his 
			domain and free him from the Abyss Order's influence. Returning to Mondstadt, Venti is ambushed by Fatui Harbinger La Signora, 
			who steals his Gnosis.</p>

			<p>Venti advises the Traveler to travel to Liyue next to meet Rex Lapis, the Geo Archon. However, during a ritual, Rex Lapis 
			is apparently killed, and his body hidden. The Traveler meets Fatui Harbinger Childe, who is secretly searching for Rex Lapis' 
			gnosis. Childe manipulates the Traveler to destabilize Liyue by relaying the news of Rex Lapis' death to the Adepti, who lose 
			faith in the Liyue Qixing. He then works with the Traveler and Zhongli, a funeral parlor consultant who is overseeing Rex Lapis' 
			funeral. While working with Zhongli, Childe discovers the location of Rex Lapis' body, which had been hidden away. The Traveler 
			confronts Childe who attempts to take the Gnosis but is unable to find it, concluding that Rex Lapis is still alive. To lure 
			out Rex Lapis, Childe summons Osial, an ancient god once defeated by Rex Lapis, but the combined forces of the Traveler, the 
			Liyue Qixing and the Adepti defeat it. Afterwards, Traveler discovers that Zhongli is the human vessel of Rex Lapis, who gives 
			his Gnosis to Signora as part of a discreet contract with the Tsaritsa. Zhongli explains he faked his death as he wished to 
			step down from his role as Archon, and that their defense of Liyue proved that they did not need his protection. Back in 
			Mondstadt, the Traveler meets a mysterious individual named Dainsleif, and together they investigate a plot by the Abyss 
			Order to create an artificial god to topple Celestia. While investigating, the Traveler reunites with their sibling, discovering
			that they have become the leader of the Abyss Order. The sibling reveals that Dainsleif was a guard of Khaenri'ah, and failed
			its people when the nation fell 500 years ago. Remarking that the Traveler will come to understand the true nature of the 
			world at the end of their journey, the sibling departs, and Dainsleif chases after them. The Traveler attempts to follow but
			is unable to, and resolves to continue their journey.</p>

			<p>The Traveler decides that their next destination will be Inazuma; however, the nation has closed off its borders under order
			of the Electro Archon, the Raiden Shogun. They find a ship captain, Beidou, who grants them passage to Inazuma after the Traveler
			wins her martial arts tournament. During the voyage, the Traveler learns more about the oppressive rule of the Raiden Shogun 
			and her decree that all Visions are to be confiscated. Arriving on Inazuma, Beidou introduces the Traveler to Thoma, the Chief 
			Retainer of the Kamisato Clan, who promises them an audience with the Raiden Shogun and invites them to the Kamisato Estate to 
			meet Ayaka, the clan's eldest daughter. The Traveler reluctantly assists the Kamisato Estate in resisting the Vision Hunt Decree.
			Thoma is captured by the Tenryou Commission and is planned to have his Vision confiscated by Raiden Shogun, but the Traveler 
			intervenes. Although they lose the duel with Raiden Shogun, they are able to escape with Thoma and his Vision. Now with a bounty
			on their head, the Traveler seeks asylum with the resistance and helps them fight the Shogun's army. The Traveler discovers that 
			the Fatui was behind the Vision Hunt Decree and raids a Fatui facility in response, but they are ultimately defeated by the Fatui 
			Harbinger Scaramouche. However, he spares their life after the Guuji of the Grand Narukami Shrine, Yae Miko, gives Scaramouche 
			the Raiden Shogun's Gnosis. Yae Miko brings the Traveler to the shrine, where she reveals she used to be close friends with the 
			Raiden Shogun and teaches the Traveler how to fight her. She then tasks the Traveler to uncover evidence that the Fatui was behind 
			the decree, which she then gives to Kujou Sara, a member of the Tenryou Commission. Sara attempts to deliver the evidence to the 
			Raiden Shogun, but is knocked out in front of her by Signora. The Traveler confronts and defeats Signora, who is subsequently 
			killed by the Raiden Shogun before she once again challenges the Traveler to a duel. Thanks to the interference of Yae Miko and 
			the power of the confiscated visions, the Traveler defeats the Raiden Shogun. Yae Miko and the Raiden Shogun reconcile, and she 
			repeals the Vision Hunt Decree.</p>
